## React router link renderer

This example renders [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) without
a protocol as [react router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) links,
while "external" links are handled with regular links. External links also get
a nice little cloud icon thrown in to symbolize they are... well, external.
The \`target\` attribute is also set to \`_blank\` on the external ones.

In much the same way as the [syntax highlighting](/code) example,
there really is very little you can't do with this flexibility.

Hard to come up with some dummy text here, so let me just throw in another
[relative link](/image) to be handled by react-router.
